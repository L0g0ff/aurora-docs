description: System requirements to comofortably use Aurora
---

Using Aurora on your computer does not require any special sauce, but there are some system requirements you should be aware of. Other than the hard requirement of a 64-bit capable CPU (AMD, Intel) you should have at least the following system specifications on your Aurora Box:

- A recent dual-core or higher multicore processor with at least 2 GHz
- 4 GB of RAM
- An SSD with at least 30GB of free space to have space for now and future updates

> Why an SSD for the install?

An HDD will work too but updates and other I/O heavy operations you might do when computing will suffer greatly and will drastically decrease your experience working with Aurora or any other OS in general.
